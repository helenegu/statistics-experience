I plotted the lattitudes and longitudes of the currently available alternative energy stations and looked at where they were. Then I overlayed the planned ones 
in black to see if they would be in locations currently lacking alternative energy stations. The states lacking stations were mostly in the West/mountain region
of the US, but they weren't the states that were getting the most new stations.
Instead, states that already had dense alternative energy stations like 
California, Florida, and New York were getting the most.
